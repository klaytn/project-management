# Project Operation Guidelines

We appreciate your interest in Klaytn. As an open source project, transparency of all development projects is an utmost priority of the Klaytn Team.
Projects are set up per module, and each project contains related development items. Anyone can track the progress of projects and items.
This document explains how to manage Klaytn SW Projects in order to assist you in making your valuable contributions to Klaytn.

## Get started
The Klaytn Team works with an annual development roadmap which includes detailed plans for each quarter. Our products are released based on the timeline set forth by the roadmap. Although the roadmap itself will be established internally, the items included will be determined on the basis of internal and external opinions, taking into account the market situation and resource status. External contributions from KIP, communities can also be included in the roadmap. You can check the version-specific development features in the [milestone](https://github.com/klaytn/klaytn/milestones).

## Milestone (Version)
- Milestone is created for each version and task unit on the roadmap.
- Milestone for each version (e.g. v1.8.0)
- Includes project tasks

## Project
Multiple [projects](https://github.com/klaytn/klaytn/projects) are being managed according to each module. Relevant development items will be added to the that project. 
Our Kanban-style project management has the following work flow:
- To Do → In Progress → (PR) Review in Progress → Done

## Unit of Work
We have defined three units of work as shown below. Select an appropriate unit using one of the following labels when you create an issue.
- Task: A high-level development item. A task may have multiple SubTasks
- SubTask: Work unit
- Story: A not development-related, high-level work item
